# CarbonThread üßµ

A blockchain-based supply chain transparency platform for sustainable product verification built on Stacks.

## Overview

CarbonThread enables manufacturers, verifiers, and consumers to track and verify the sustainability credentials of products throughout their entire supply chain journey. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create an immutable record of a product's environmental impact, certifications, and supply chain steps. Now featuring **carbon offset integration** to help products achieve carbon neutrality through verified carbon credits.

## Features

- **Product Registration**: Manufacturers can register products with sustainability metrics
- **Certification Management**: Authorized verifiers can issue and manage sustainability certifications
- **Supply Chain Tracking**: Track products through each step of the supply chain
- **Verification System**: Independent verification of supply chain steps and certifications
- **Carbon Offset Integration**: Purchase and link carbon credits to products for carbon neutrality
- **Carbon Credit Management**: Track and verify carbon offset purchases and retirements
- **Transparency**: Public access to product sustainability data and carbon offset status
